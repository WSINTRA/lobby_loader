# Lobby Loader
MVP
An advanced game lobby app; a user registers and tells the system what games they own. 
Once a user is registered they can login and create a new party. 
Other users can then join the party and send messages to the party.
A party will have an upper limit of members, once that is reached a notification will be sent to all members of the party to tell them to commence the game.

### Notes
Built this app as part of a project to develop React and Redux skills. 

```
git clone https://github.com/WSINTRA/lobby_loader
cd lobby_loader
npm install
npm run

```
Backend uses a PostGreSQL database. Make sure you are running it on port 3050.
